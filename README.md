# Data Science Projects
Within this repository, there are a number of data science projects about a variety of topics.
## Happiness Score Prediction
This analysis was completed to investigate the reported happiness levels of U.S. universities given attributes about the campus, student population, etc. This project reinforced the data science process and improved fluency in exploratory data analysis, feature selection, machine learning methods, and presentation of findings.
## Social Determinants of Health
This analysis was my first attempt at the data science process. I compiled and cleaned freely available datasets describing social factors of U.S. counties to predict their emergency department visit rates, collaborated with a team of three to bring together many different viewpoints to gain a better understanding of the task. We presented our findings to a panel to educate the public about the social determinants of health and what implications they had on the population, and I strengthened my knowledge of machine learning (decision trees, ensemble methods), the data science process, teamwork in the data science setting, feature selection and engineering, and the impact social factors can have on health.
